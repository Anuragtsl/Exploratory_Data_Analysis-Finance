# Exploratory_Data_Analysis-Finance

I have done Data Analysis on Bank Loan Modelling dataset.

In this I've used Pythonâ€™s Famous libraries like [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/getting-started/#:~:text=Plotly%20for%20Python.-,Overview,3%2Ddimensional%20use%2Dcases.), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/), [Scipy](https://www.scipy.org/), etc for analysis.

I've used [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) for coding!

I obtained the Dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/krantiswalke/bank-personal-loan-modelling).

# Data Description

**The file Bank.xls contains data on 5000 customers. The data include customer demographic information (age, income, etc.), the customer's relationship with the bank (mortgage, securities account, etc.), and the customer response to the last personal loan campaign (Personal Loan). Among these 5000 customers, only 480 (= 9.6%) accepted the personal loan that was offered to them in the earlier campaign.**

***You can follow along the Jupyter Notebook for more!***

# Conclusion

Hope you like my project on Bank Loan Modelling Dataset,

I have performed some Hypothesis Testing:-
  *  How Age of a person is going to be a factor in availing loan ???
  
    *  Ans:- Age does not have impact on availing personal loan, as the p_value > 0.05 with a value of 0.584959263705325
   
  *  Does Income of a person have an impact on availing loan ??? 
  
    *  Ans:- Income does have impact on availing personal loan, as the p_value < 0.05 with a value of 0.0
   
  *  Does the family size makes them to avail loan ???
  
    *  Ans:- Family have phenomenal significance on availing personal Loan , As the P_value is less than 0.05 with a value of :1.4099040685673807e-05

**And Much More!!**
